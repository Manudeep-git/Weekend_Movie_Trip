# Weekend Movie Trip
Project based on Clustering, Introduction to Data Science project 3

Clustering

The following objectives were listed for the project


1.Download the one of the MovieLens datasets from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ </br>
2.Load the data set into panda data frames </br>
3. Formulate one or two ideas on how the combination of ratings and tags by
users helps the data set to establish additional value using exploratory data analysis </br>
4.Build one or more clustering models to determine similar movies to
recommend using the other ratings and tags of movies by other users as
features</br>
